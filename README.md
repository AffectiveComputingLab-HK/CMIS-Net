## CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation

**CMIS-Net** proposes a multi-scale approach for backchannel agreement estimation. The method performs individual standardization at both the frame-level and sequence-level, extracting individual-invariant features that are then used for more accurate backchannel agreement estimation.

## Dataset
Our model was trained and validated on [MPIIGroupInteraction](https://multimediate-challenge.org/datasets/Dataset_MPII/) dataset.  

We specifically used the **backchannel agreement annotations** provided in the dataset to perform the **agreement estimation** task.

## Usage

Before starting the training, make sure to extract facial keypoints from each video frame using [OpenFace2.0](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace).

To run the training you can call:

```sh
bash train.sh
```

or 

```
python train.py --feat_path /Path/to/your/features --label_path /Path/to/your/labels
```
